## Task1 : IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements..

dataset : https://tinyurl.com/yn75uesz

github : https://t.ly/u5pe

here, For this dataset applied  Scikit-learn library  for classify the different species of iris flowers.

## Task2 : UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. 

We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate .....

dataset : https://tinyurl.com/48xfy77w

github : https://t.ly/1I1_

here, In this  model_..Seaborn and Matplotlib uses various graphs and plots to show the rate of unemployment.

## Task3 : CAR PRICE PREDICTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING

The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. 

dataset :

github : https://t.ly/nmtC

Here, the machine learning model is used to predict the Car price using independent variables like car name, horsepower, engine size and so on. 

And the model uses a Decision Tree algorithm to predict the cost of a car with these parameters.

## Task4 : EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING

Weâ€™ve all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content.

dataset : https://tinyurl.com/y59kjcxz

github : https://t.ly/svrE

here,In this Project, use Python to build an email spam detector. Then, use machine learning to train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam. 



## Task5 : SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON

Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.

dataset : https://tinyurl.com/yckd5hxy

github : https://t.ly/as7j

Here, the machine learning model is used to predict the sales of advertising media items like tv, radio, and newspaper. And the model uses a Multiple Linear Regression Algorithm to predict the sales of items on a scale.
